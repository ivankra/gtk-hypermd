# gtk-hypermd

Minimalistic WYSIWIG Markdown editor and note-taking application for GTK+/GNOME desktop based on WebKit and [HyperMD](https://github.com/laobubu/HyperMD).

Featuring:
* HyperMD, a WYSIWIG Markdown editor: break the Wall between writing and previewing
* Uncluttered interface with a modern GTK+/GNOME look
* Tray-icon mode: your notes are always just a click away
* Free, open-source and privacy conscious: no cloud (possibly an option later), no tracking, no telemetry and other nonsense like that

The software at the moment is an early prototype, basic function work, but is far from feature complete.
