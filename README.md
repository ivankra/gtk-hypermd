# gtk-hypermd

Minimalistic WYSIWIG Markdown editor and note-taking application for GTK+/GNOME desktop based on WebKit and [HyperMD](https://github.com/laobubu/HyperMD).

Featuring:
* HyperMD, a WYSIWIG Markdown editor: break the Wall between writing and previewing
* Uncluttered interface with a modern GTK+/GNOME look
* Tray-icon mode
* Free, open-source and privacy conscious: no cloud, no tracking, no telemetry and other nonsense like that

The software is at the moment usable, basic functions work, but is still very much an early alpha/prototype and far from feature complete.
